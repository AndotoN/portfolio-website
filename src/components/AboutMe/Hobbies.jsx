            I have a deep love for my home country, Bulgaria. The country’s
            breathtaking landscapes, from the majestic mountains to the
            beautiful seaside, have always been a source of inspiration and joy
            for me. One of my favorite hobbies is camping in these beautiful
            locations—whether it's the serene mountains or the tranquil seaside,
            I always find peace and adventure in the heart of nature. Exploring
            Bulgaria's natural beauty helps me recharge and reconnect with the
            environment, offering a refreshing balance to my work in technology.

            Another hobby that I’m passionate about is playing video games,
            especially strategy-based games. I enjoy the mental challenge and
            tactical thinking required to outwit opponents and solve in-game
            problems. It also serves as a creative outlet and a great way to
            unwind after a day of coding. Combining these two hobbies—immersing
            myself in nature and indulging in strategy games—keeps me both
            mentally and physically engaged.
